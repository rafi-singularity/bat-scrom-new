          Rapide is widely recognized market research agency in the county
          and its previous risk rating before expiry was low risk. Hence,
          it is not critical to have the AFC assessment and the subsequent
          mitigation action plans completed immediately.

          Given Shakib’s familiarity with Rapide, contacting them and
          shortlisting them for the project was the right course of
          action.

          As the cost of the survey was already budgeted, it was okay for
          Shakib to give the go-ahead to Rapide without getting a second
          competitive quotation from another vendor.
