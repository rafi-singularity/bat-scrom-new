        No matter how reliable Rapide is in the market, contracts must be
        updated for all vendors in the system. While working with any supplier-
        old or new- make sure the AFC risk assessment is the first thing you do.

          Rapide is widely recognized market research agency in the county and
          its previous risk rating before expiry was low risk. Hence, it is not
          critical to have the AFC assessment and the subsequent mitigation
          action plans completed immediately.

      <div class="mcq" data-aos="fade-up">
        <div>C</div>
        <p>
          Given Shakibâ€™s familiarity with Rapide, contacting them and
          shortlisting them for the project was the right course of action.

          As the cost of the survey was already budgeted, it was okay for Shakib
          to give the go-ahead to Rapide without getting a second competitive
          quotation from another vendor.
