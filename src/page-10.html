            Rapide is widely recognized market research agency in the county and
            its previous risk rating before expiry was low risk. Hence, it is
            not critical to have the AFC assessment and the subsequent
            mitigation action plans completed immediately.

        >
          <div>C</div>
          <p>
            Given Shakib’s familiarity with Rapide, contacting them and
            shortlisting them for the project was the right course of action.

          <p>
            As the cost of the survey was already budgeted, it was okay for
            Shakib to give the go-ahead to Rapide without getting a second
            competitive quotation from another vendor.
