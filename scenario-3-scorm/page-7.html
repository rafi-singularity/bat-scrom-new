          Shakib wilfully obtained confidential information from a Public
          Official, an action that breaches our SoBC Policy. We must engage with
          openness, transparency, and integrity. Moreover, he offered a ‘gift’
          to a Public Official to extract information out of him. This exchange
          may warrant a disciplinary action such as a verbal or written warning,
          or even a termination of his contract.

            Shakib is being collaborative by supporting the Regulatory Affairs
            team to meet their regulatory engagement goals. We need to work
            together as one team, no matter what it takes.

            The information is not yet public, so Shakib has induced a Public
            Official to breach a duty of confidentiality. Shakib should not have
            asked Tahmid for the report and should have refused to accept the
            report even if Tahmid had offered it.

            Shakib could be said to have offered the Formula 1 ticket as a gift
            to Tahmid to obtain a favour on behalf of the business. It is
            completely unacceptable for anyone connected to the business to be
            involved in any activity relating to bribery and corruption, even
            for the sake of achieving business results.

            Shakib is being proactive by getting the draft regulation; one
            should be able to use on one’s social network in times like this.
