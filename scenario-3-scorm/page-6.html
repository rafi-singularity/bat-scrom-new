            Shakib wilfully obtained confidential information from a Public
            Official, an action that breaches our SoBC Policy. We must engage
            with openness, transparency, and integrity. Moreover, he offered a
            ‘gift’ to a Public Official to extract information out of him. This
            exchange may warrant a disciplinary action such as a verbal or
            written warning, or even a termination of his contract.

              Shakib is being collaborative by supporting the Regulatory Affairs
              team to meet their regulatory engagement goals. We need to work
              together as one team, no matter what it takes.

              The information is not yet public, so Shakib has induced a Public
              Official to breach a duty of confidentiality. Shakib should not
              have asked Tahmid for the report and should have refused to accept
              the report even if Tahmid had offered it.

              Shakib could be said to have offered the Formula 1 ticket as a
              gift to Tahmid to obtain a favour on behalf of the business. It is
              completely unacceptable for anyone connected to the business to be
              involved in any activity relating to bribery and corruption, even
              for the sake of achieving business results.

              Shakib is being proactive by getting the draft regulation; one
              should be able to use on one’s social network in times like this.
