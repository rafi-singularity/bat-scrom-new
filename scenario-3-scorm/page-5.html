          Eventually, Tahmid discloses that the government is not in favor of
          approving the New Category product. With this information at hand,
          Shakib now goes to his line manager to discuss the way forward. What
          do you think about what Shakib has done? Select the most appropriate
          options.

            Shakib is being collaborative by supporting the Regulatory Affairs

            The information is not yet public, so Shakib has induced a Public
            Official to breach a duty of confidentiality. Shakib should not have
            asked Tahmid for the report and should have refused to accept the
            report even if Tahmid had offered it.

            Shakib could be said to have offered the Formula 1 ticket as a gift
            to Tahmid to obtain a favour on behalf of the business. It is
            completely unacceptable for anyone connected to the business to be
            involved in any activity relating to bribery and corruption, even
            for the sake of achieving business results.

            Shakib is being proactive by getting the draft regulation; one
            should be able to use on one’s social network in times like this.
